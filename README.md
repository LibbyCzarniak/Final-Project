# Final-Project

Summary:
  In this project we had two main goals. The first one was to create a dashboard where the user can look at NFL scouting combine
  statistics from the years 2000-2017. They can either input their own players statistics or look for general statistics for that
  player in a certain type of test. We also created a regression model that we used to try and predict certain NFL statistics for 
  different types of postitions.

  The deepnote consists of three notebooks:
  
  Cleaning Data for Dashboard: where we clean the data that we use in the python file for the dashboard
  
  Cleaning Data for Model: where we clean the data used for the model in the next notebook 
  
  Model: where we create a regression models that predict certain NFL statistics for four different categories of positions
    
app.py file has the code used for the dashboard
